# Proximity-indices-between-technologies-applied-to-OpenAlex
This projects aims at measuring the proximity between cybersecurity technologies under the form of time series based on bibliometric data taken from Openalex.

The project is divided in 3 parts: the creation of the data, the exploration of the data, and the creation, visualization and forecasting of proximity indices. Each part is contained in one specific folder. Each folder contains a file called "directory_file" + something specific to the specific folder. If you run this file, it runs all the other files contained in this folder in the right order.
At the same level of the folders, there is a file called "directory_file", which runs all the directory files specific to each folder in the right order. The only thing one has to do, is to download manually "m4_monthly_scaled.pkl" and "m4_monthly_scaled.pkl" from https://github.com/unit8co/amld2022-forecasting-and-metalearning/tree/main/data and to put them in the folder called "indices_proximity". These files are used then for the transfer learning part and I could not download them automatically, because of some technical problems.
Once this is done, one can simply run the main directory file and then all the files are ran. Note that the whole computations might take approximately a week to be run.
